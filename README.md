# Mapping_Earthquakes
- The purpose of this challenge is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To complete this challenge, a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website was used and geographical coordinates as well as magnitudes of earthquakes for the past seven days were retrieved and added to a map.
